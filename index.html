            Rohit Sharma has been one of the most successful players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) as captain since 2013 of the Mumbai Indians, who have won the tournament five times under his leadership. He is currently (July 2019) one of ten players who have scored 4,000 career runs in the competition. Sharma has 4,898 with one century and is the third highest run scorer after Virat Kohli and Suresh Raina.

            Sharma joined the IPL in 2008 when he was signed by the Deccan Chargers franchise, based in Hyderabad, for the sum of US$750,000 a year. In the 2011 auction, he was sold for US$2 million to the Mumbai Indians. He scored his only IPL century in the 2012 tournament with 109 (not out) against the Kolkata Knight Riders. Under his leadership, Mumbai have won the IPL in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019 and 2020; they also won the former Champions League Twenty20 competition in 2013.
        </h2>

        <h2>
            Sharma holds the world record for the highest individual score by a batsman playing in a one-day international match, having scored 264 against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on 13 November 2014. He is the only player to have scored three double-centuries in this form of international cricket. In January 2020, Sharma was named as the ODI Player of the Year by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
            <br>
On 5 October 2019, during a Test match against South Africa, Sharma became the first batsman to score two centuries in a match on his first appearance as an opening batsman. In the same series, he broke Shimron Hetmyer's record for the highest number of sixes in a Test series.
